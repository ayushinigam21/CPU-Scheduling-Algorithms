# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
The primary responsibility of an operating system is to efficiently handle a group of processes, a task known as CPU scheduling. This project focuses on three specific scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First Come First Serve), RM Scheduling (Rate Monotonic), and RR Scheduling (Round Robin). The objective is to analyze these scheduling methods and determine which algorithm achieves the highest level of optimization.

FCFS, as its name suggests, prioritizes processes based on their arrival time, executing them in the order they arrive. This approach ensures fairness but may result in longer waiting times for processes with higher execution times.

RM Scheduling, on the other hand, employs priority-based scheduling, where processes with shorter periods or higher priorities are given precedence. By assigning priorities based on relative deadlines, this algorithm ensures that processes with tighter time constraints are executed promptly. However, it may lead to lower overall CPU utilization.

RR Scheduling operates by allocating a fixed time slice, known as a time quantum, to each process in a circular manner. This allows processes to take turns executing, with each process receiving a fair share of the CPU's processing time. While this algorithm reduces waiting time and ensures responsiveness, it may result in increased overhead due to frequent context switching.

To determine which algorithm achieves maximum optimization, various performance metrics must be considered. These include average waiting time, turnaround time, response time, and CPU utilization. By comparing these metrics across the three scheduling algorithms, it will be possible to identify the most efficient approach.

Ultimately, the choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system. For systems with strict deadlines and time constraints, RM Scheduling may be the optimal choice. Meanwhile, if fairness and simplicity are prioritized, FCFS may suffice. RR Scheduling strikes a balance between fairness and responsiveness, making it suitable for scenarios where interactive response times are important. The analysis of these algorithms will shed light on their strengths and weaknesses, helping to determine the most optimized scheduling method for a given system.
